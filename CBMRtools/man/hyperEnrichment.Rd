\title{Carry out set enrichment test based on hyper-geometric distribution}
\usage{
hyperEnrichment(
  drawn,
  categories,
  ntotal = length(unique(unlist(categories))),
  min.drawsize = 4,
  mht = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{drawn}{One or more sets of 'drawn' items (e.g., genes). Basically, a list of signatures.}

\item{categories}{list of gene sets (e.g., MSigDB c2)}

\item{ntotal}{background population, i.e., the total no. of items from which items are supposed to have been drawn}

\item{min.drawsize}{min no. of drawn items that must be among categories' items}

\item{mht}{correct for multiple hypothesis testing across multiple 'draws'}
}
\value{
a data.frame with rows indexed by the signature(s) tested
}

\examples{

# load objects hyperSig (a list of signatures) and hyperGsets (a GeneSet object)
# and run hyper-enrichment test

data(hyper) # contains objects hyperSig and hyperGsets
hyperE <- hyperEnrichment(drawn=hyperSig,categories=getGeneSet(hyperGsets),ntotal=10000)
head(hyperE)
